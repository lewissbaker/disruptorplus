    /// items to a ring buffer.
    ///
    /// This strategy avoids the overhead required to synchronise multiple
    /// threads trying to claim slots in the ring buffer.
    ///
    /// A writer thread starts by first claiming one or more slots in the ring buffer
    /// by calling one of the 'claim' methods. The writer then writes to the slots
    /// and indicates to readers it has finished writing to the slots by calling
    /// publish().
    ///
    /// Reader threads can wait until a writer thread has published an element
    /// to the ring buffer by calling one of the wait_until_published() methods.
    ///
    /// Readers indicate they are finished reading from a slot in the ring buffer
    /// by publishing the sequence number of the latest item they are finished
    /// with in the 'claim barrier'. This frees the slot up for writers to
    /// subsequently claim it for future writes.
